## 8. Future Expansion

- Community Methodology Marketplace for sharing workflows.
- AI-powered recommendations for next testing steps.
- Integration with bug bounty platforms.
- Cross-platform support for mobile and tablet usage.

## 9. Competitive Landscape

While platforms like Dradis, Faraday, PlexTrac, and AttackForge offer elements of documentation, tool integration, or project tracking, none combine:

- Custom methodology creation
- Direct tool execution
- Manual testing guidance
- Automatic evidence logging

in a single, user-friendly platform.

This positions the proposed solution as first-to-market in its category.
